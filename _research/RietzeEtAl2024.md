In 2020, the Northeastern Siberian lowland tundra faced an extreme drought and unprecedented wildfires. My colleague Vitalii Zemlianskii was in the region that year and took a picture of this dried tributary of the Berelekh river near the Kytalyk research station, shrouded in haze from unprecedented wildfires.

In this paper, we studied the impact of the extreme summer drought in 2020 on the tundra vegetation in the Indigirka lowlands using a combination of in-situ data, thermal, and multispectral drone imagery.

The fine-scale vegetation types revealed increased landscape-wide drought susceptibility indicated by an overall loss of land surface cooling. This suggests a shift towards an energy budget dominated by sensible heat flux, which may feed back and intensify the heatwave.
