<b>Hi, I'm Nils.</b> <br> I'm a PhD student in Earth System Sciences in the <a href="https://www.ieu.uzh.ch/en/research/ecology/spatial.html">Spatial Ecology and Remote Sensing Group</a> and <a href="https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/rs/research/TIRLab.html">TIRlab</a> at the University of Zurich. My PhD is part of a larger project contributing to the TRISHNA mission, an upcoming satellite mission focussing on high-resolution thermal remote sensing. I apply remote sensing techniques across spatial scales to study the effects of heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires on Arctic tundra ecosystems.
